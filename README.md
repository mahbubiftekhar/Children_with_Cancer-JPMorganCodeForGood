This was a competitive 24-hour coding competition where we delivered a scalable solution to a Non-Governmental Organisation. In this program, we collaborated with other coders in a team to develop an innovative technological solution for a non-profit organisation - Children with Cancer UK. 


## The Charity
[Children with Cancer UK](https://www.childrenwithcancer.org.uk/)
<img alt="JP Morgan CODE FOR GOOD 2018" src="/IMAGES/childrenWIthCancer.png" width="600" height="250">

The mission for Children with Cancer UK is to improve survival rates and the quality of survival in young cancer patients and to find ways to prevent cancer in the future.

## OUR GOAL

The purpose of the web application was to offer the following:

- A platform for supporting children and their loved ones through any related hardship
- Provide an immediate community to interact, socialise and share experiences    
- Signposting valuable information to all user groups
